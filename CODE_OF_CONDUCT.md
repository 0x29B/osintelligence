# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the **Awesome Tools Collection** project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free and respectful experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes, and learning from them
* Focusing on what is best not just for individuals, but for the community as a whole

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of behavior that are not acceptable in our community include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information (such as addresses, emails, or personal identifiers) without explicit consent
* Submitting malicious or illegal tools or resources
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or open-source setting

## OSINT-Specific Guidelines

* Respect privacy and adhere to legal boundaries
* Do not use tools for stalking, harassment, or illegal activity
* Follow responsible disclosure practices when handling sensitive information

### Information Sharing

* Verify information before sharing it with the community
* Respect confidentiality when required
* Do not share personal information without consent
* Be mindful of potential harm when sharing intelligence or research findings

### Tool Submissions

* Only submit tools you have personally tested and confirmed as safe
* Ensure tools serve legitimate OSINT purposes
* Do not submit or promote tools designed for malicious use
* Provide clear, accurate, and honest descriptions of submitted tools

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers and community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate, fair corrective action in response to behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (including issues, commits, code, wiki edits, discussions, and comments) that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies across all community spaces related to the **Awesome Tools Collection** project, including GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and other project-related platforms.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (for example, using an official email address, posting via official social accounts, or presenting at events).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at **[conduct@osintelligence.net](mailto:conduct@osintelligence.net)**.

All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and resolved fairly and promptly.

Project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of reporters of incidents.
